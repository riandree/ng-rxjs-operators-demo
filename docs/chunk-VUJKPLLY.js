Each value provided below is put into each of those Observables/Subjects and each of those Observables is configured to use either the min, max or count operators.
On clicking the 'on subjects complete()' button below all of those Observables are completed and the console
shows the result of each of those operators. Please provide a series of numbers using the textfield and the 'next' button below.

And finally complete the series of numbers using this button. Only after completing the source observables will
the observales emit their final values (here the minimum, maximum and number of values aggregated of all values received until the source observables completed).
